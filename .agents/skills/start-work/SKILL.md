# Start work

Read AGENTS.md, docs/project.md and docs/workflow.md from the repository root. Reuse unchanged context. For instructions/Skills also read docs/context.md.

On Windows use docs/setup/windows.md and scripts/python.ps1. Normal implementation targets develop; GUI-not-required tooling may target main. Never infer a remote branch or Issue exists from these defaults.

Inspect the Issue/comments, related PRs, ownership, dependencies, branch, worktrees and dirty state. Search before creating an Issue. Claim scope, owner, base, target, reviewer, GUI need and next action, then read back. Unreleased claims do not expire. Resume in your existing worktree; take over only after reassignment and old-writer stop, in a separate worktree.

Fetch without disturbing edits. Branch from the configured integration branch into `agent|codex|claude|cursor/<issue>-<slug>` in a dedicated worktree. Remove an inherited upstream to the integration branch. Install hooks with `python3 scripts/bootstrap.py` after inspecting them; preserve custom hooks on conflict.

Record observable acceptance, real project checks and remaining GUI/release conditions in the Issue. Create a Draft PR on the first meaningful push. Continue through finish-work; setup or a Draft PR alone is not completion. Referencing agents, server settings or GUI capabilities does not authorize their use.
